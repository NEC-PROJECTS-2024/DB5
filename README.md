### INTRODUCTION
  The earth's ecosystem depends heavily on forest fires[1], which occur frequently. It happens all around the world, every month of the year. As such, it poses a severe risk to civilization, carries a high financial burden, and is a major factor in ecological shifts. Every year, 2.3% of the world's land area burns, which has a significant impact on ecosystems and human livelihoods. Each year, millions of hectares are lost due to forest fires, depleting the availability of oxygen, The earth's climate[2] is changing due in large part to the loss of these species and the increase in carbon dioxide.
